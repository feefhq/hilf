# Arrow functions

Prefer arrow functions for all function declarations (including exported components and hooks).

- Use `const fn = (...) => { ... }` or `const fn = (...) => (...)`
- Use `export const Component = (props) => (...)` for React components
- Use `export const useHook = () => { ... }` for hooks

This is enforced by Biome: `complexity.useArrowFunction: "error"` in `biome.json`. Run `npx biome check --write` to auto-fix.
